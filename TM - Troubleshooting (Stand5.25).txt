How to unglitch a Time Machine Disk - fastest way

This guidance is written for a time machine used via cable. I don't know if it worked with a network one

If your time machine has failed and now you can't start a new one or you are having problem getting your disk read 
[even though it's visible in disk utility] and Time machine still fails even after erasing it, follow these steps:

1. Cancel the folder Backups.backupdb

2. Restart the computer (so that you can delete trash and time machine is forced ejected)

	Restarting the computer is barely oriented to this two targets

3. Connect time machine once again and check status on disk utility 

4. Open terminal and delete local snapshots

	tmutil listlocalsnapshots/

	tmutil deletelocalsnapshots 

	#add [date] if you want to delete just one

5. Start the backup as usual 



Useful bonus commands:

P.s: Force ejection of a time machine 

sudo diskutil unmountDisk force /dev/disk4

sudo diskutil eject /dev/disk4
